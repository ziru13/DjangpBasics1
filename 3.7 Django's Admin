one of the Django killer features, 
one of the thing you show the old school PHP ??? developer to make their Java's??? job
is "django admin"
it's just the fact that you have to do so little work to get something that is so useful

the project is still running, let's got to project's "admin"
		http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/l  出现一个Django Administration的登录网页,有用户名,密码,登录键
		
we have to log in, the last thing we want is a random person of the internet logging in and messing our site
let's go back to the terminal to create an account, and kill out server ==== ctrl + C

your probably ??? a pattern here, we have to create something and there is a django command for us,
we are going to use the one call "createsuperuser"
==== py manage.py createsuperuser
		Username (leave blank to use'ziruf'): chickenfish
		Email address: djangobasics@test.com
		Password:  (不会显示出来的 zirufish)
		Password (again):
		Superuser created successfully.

when you do this for your actual lie-on??? the internet site, you make sure have a very good password
run again and see if we can log in
==== py manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000

when we first log in we only have two things in the admin "Users" and "Groups"
these are two "Models" that are provided by django,
and they are under the "Authentication and Authorization" header
they belong to Django's "off"??? app
with django give it a custom name in the admin, 
that's why it says "Authentication and Authorization" instead of just "OFF"???
		Authentication and Authorization
			Groups
			Users
			

let's see what's in the area for "Users", there is the user account we created
we can search for users, filter them by different statics on the right side

let's click on the "Username", it's a form for changing all of our user's details
the "change user" page shows--（http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/user/1/change/）

"Django developers" has to do very little work to make this exactly form show up
let's see what we have to do to get something useful in the admin
go back to  the courses' app, and we have the "courses/admin.py"
we can see that it has a message telling us to "Register your models here"
so first thing we need to do is "import the models"
			from .models import Course

			# Register your models here.
			admin.site.register(Course)   # admin, the currently exist site, and we're gonna register "Course", 

so we registered our model, we see that the server restarted, let's check the "admin" in the page
let's click on "Home", and we got the "Courses" header and "Courses" below it
		Authentication and Authorization
			Groups
			Users
			
		COURSES
			Courses
			
let's check that out, that is the each of the course we created in the shell
		Select course to change
		Course
		Object-Oriented Python
		Python Collection
		Python Basics

let's look on "Python Basics", anf there is a form with "Title" on??? and "Description" field
		Change Course
		Title           Python Basics
		Description			Learn the basics of Python
		
		
		Delete		Save and add another			Save and continue editing		SAVE   (buttons)
		
now, where is the "created_at" field, where is the "id" we saw in migration?
the "id" is automatically set, it's auto???ting, 
so django is like "ok, you don't need that, I hide that away"
and kinda same idea with our "created_at" field, we set it to be "auto_now_add" as "True"  (models.py)
so Django goes "Ok, you not going to be editing that because you're setting it automatically, 
	so I'll just hide it for you, cause you don't need that"
	
let's see about creating a "new course", go "Home", "COURSES/Courses", "ADD COURSE +" button
we can also just click its "Add", let's do this way
			Add course
			Title						Python Testing
			Description			Learn to test your Python application with unittest and doctest!
			
in the "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/courses/course/" page, we have four courses,
that is so much easier than the creating step in the shell

adding model instances through the shell is simple enough, 
but "django-admin" is even easier, we will the the "admin" later
