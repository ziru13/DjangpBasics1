so far, we have a project with an app, a global project wide??? view--our home page, there is??? a template,
that template also uses a "master layout" template, in our app, we have two models, two migrations
we have a model registered with Django's admin and we have a view to see all of the courses we've created
now, let's go seeing the details of a single course
now, we have two models: "Course" and "Step" and our administer setup??? to edit both of them nicely
so, let's see about adding a view for looking at a single course as as student

go to "courses/views.py"
we have a way to view all of the courses, we get all the course's names
let's open it up in the page "http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/", it shows all the course's name and descriptions
so,we have our admin, our view, our editor, lots of tabs for editing Django sometimes
it can be nice if we can just click one the "Course name", 
like "Python Basics" and go see all the steps that are in the course
normally we call this kind of view when you're drilling into just a single item, a "detail view"
cuz we're reading the details??? of a particular item, 
so we have the "views.py" open, let's create this new view, we don't need to import anything, 
but we need to catch the primary key which is the id field by default, and we didn't define one, 
cuz Django automatically creates one for us, 
		def course_detail(request, pk):
			course = Course.objects.get(pk=pk)
			return render(request, 'courses/course_detail.html', {'course': course})
		
		# as a direct request??? and take a "pk", this tells python that we're going to have two arguments to our view
		# Django automatically supplies the request, when it call the "view" function
		# and we'll provide the "pk" through our url
		# the rest of the view is very straightforward, we need to get the course of the given "pk" then render the template
		# we didn't define the "pk" attribute, so where it comes from?
		# Django knows what field is our primary key, which is what "pk" stands for, primary key,by default is the id
		# so Django is like "Oh, you want the primary key, you want the id, here you go, let's just go to it"
		# so we'll deal with what happens if the course didn't exist, a little bit later on, 
		# now we'll just pretend nobody's gonna type in a bad url???, so we need a url for this
		
go to "courses/urls.py"
we need to add a new line in the next "url" that is similar with the upper one
		urlpatterns = [
    	url(r'^$', views.course_list),
    	url(r'(?P<pk>/d+)/$', views.course_detail),
]
		
		# we're gonna catch a "pk"-?P<pk>, /d, + means more than one of those,/$ end the line
		# then go to "views.course_detail"
		# ?P<pk>: a name to group, we call this "group pk"
		# /d: one or more digits, that come in the url, then go to "views.course_detail"
		# we left off the Chevron???"^", because other "url.py"(learning/urls.py)
		# it can starts with the "courses", it can starts with the "pk"
		
lastly, we need a template, "courses/templates/courses ", we gonna create a new file "course_detail.html"
inside "courses/templates/courses/course_detail.html"
we want to extend "layout.html" and then we want to be able to set some stuffs

		{% extends "layout.html %}

		{% block title %}{{ course.title }}{% endblock %}
		
		{% block content %}
		<article>
			<h2>{{ course.title }}</h2>
			{{ course.description }}
			
			<section>
				{% for step in course.step_set.all %}
					<h3>{{ step.title }}</h3>
					{{ step.description }}
				{% endfor %}
			</section>
		</article>
		{% endblock %}
		
		# {% block title %} is equal to whatever course we're looking at, that course's title
		# then "block content", we're gonna do any little bit of??? extra HTML, we make an <article> tag
		# and the <h2> tag with the course title, then "course description"
		# we should print out the name for each step in our course, 
		# by looping through a special new attribute called "step_set"---{% for step in course.step_set.all %}
		# "step_set" is a query set, and we can query against it, so we use "all" function to get all of them
		# we don't use "all()" with (), inside Django template
		# inside wo have <h3> and print out sth

then let's see how it renders, we know that "Python Basics" is No.1, 
so go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/1/", it shows the content below
		
			Python Basics
			Learn the basics of Python
			what's the deal with strings?
			Strings are more than just a bunch of letters. Find out why.
			
the course title and description, step title and description

Django's ORM really help this out there with that "step_set" attribute, 
sometimes though it ends up being a less-than-optimal??? addition to your queries,
