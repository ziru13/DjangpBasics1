if we have to repeat every all these HTMLs that our site needed, headers, footers, menus ect in every single template
that get pretty old. wen didn't even use any of these stuffs in the two templates we made, 
but it's sure being nice to be able to have a link to our course's page on every page of our site
this is noe place our "Template Inheritance" comes in really handy

Templates that inherit from each other are a fun part of most templates insistences???
most of the time you have a master or parent template, that everything else extends from
we work on some projects though where the intermediate templates too
so maybe the top most almost are really like a "grandparent" or "great-grandparent" template???
the Django approach to this is really simple, so go back to the "Directory sector", 

inside of this out of most "templates" directory, let's make a new "layout.html" file
we're gonna put in the basic of an html page, nothing ground-breaking here
			<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html lang="en">
    		<head>
        	<title></title>
    		</head>
    		<body>

    		</body>
			</html>
			
??? inheritances b???, but template's inheritance works kinda like class inheritance does
and object oriented programming, when we extend a parent template, we get everything that's in it,
but that means we also need a way to override what's in there 
and what's the stuffs that we want to have from our child/grandchild template
just like we get it??? reassign an attribute or redefine an method in a parent class
Django's template we do that by defining overridable blocks in our parent templates
let's take a couple of them in here, we're gonna put one inside the title tag, and the body tag
			<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html lang="en">
    		<head>
        	<title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
    		</head>
    		<body>{% block content %}{% endblock %}</body>
			</html>

as you can see our "template's blocks" have a starting tag, that is the block's name, title/content,
and they both have a closing in the block tag as well
				<title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>  整个block都在标签内
				<body>{% block content %}{% endblock %}</body>
what's kinda neat is if we want to we can actually say {% endblock title %}/{% endblock content %}, but we don't have to

let's go edit the "home.html" template, since we just have it kind of handy there 
and we're gonna add one line to its top {% extends "layout.html" %}, 
this says "hey, fetch everything that's in this html ans use that", let's just save and go render this again
we got nothing in the page, why? becuase there is nothing in the "layout.html" template 
and we didn't do anything in the "home.html" template, we just takes "extends" in it, we didn't override any blocks
so let's override a block,and the do a block content around our existing <h1>, 
			{% block title %}Hello there!{% endblock %}
			{% block content %}
			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			{% endblock %}
then come back to the page again and refresh, we get "Hello there!" in the title and our <h1> "Welcome!"

template inheritance is a super handy part of Django template insistence
before we get back to the python side of our Django project, let's look at one more important part of template
and our site design and assets
