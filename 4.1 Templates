Course 4: Django Template
** user-facing interface 面向用户
** 如何添加和使用HTML模板到Django项目中
** 在我们的项目中CSS assets的使用
==================================================
templates in Django are a lot like templates in Flask
if you are not familiar with the idea of template in system???, it usually involves a few parts
templates are usually HTML, that has special tags and commands in it
	{{ course.title}}, this tag that you print our data, 
										 create loops, conditionals 
										 and perform other programing constructs
	templates are also often inheritable or extendable
	so you can write small templates that fits into larger ones to save yourself trouble
	
in Django, templates can be any language you want, HTML, Json, XML, something else entirely
they just have to be text, but we are going to create HTML templates
because we want to give our user pages to look at in the browser

the first template we want to make is one for the "course list view"----views.py
it list out the names, but it's not very useful, so let's fix that
by default, django looks for a template directory inside of your app directory,
now we don't have one, so we need to make one in  the "courses"
it also expects inside "templates" that you'll have a folder/directory with the same name as your app
so "courses/templates/courses", the reason we do this is 
so that we have all of our app's specific templates inside this "name space" directory "courses"
then if we need to let people override them, they just make their own "templates" directory name "courses"
or if we want to have templates that ??? like save multiple sections we can name them different names...

创建 course_list.html (courses/template/courses/course_list.html)
of course it doesn't have to be the same name as our view (def course_list), it's just easy for us to know that it's a list of the courses
in here, we'll write a "list of a template", and that list will have all the courses
django lets us do "for" loop in our template, inside of this loop
we want to print out the "title" and "description" of the course, we use two {{}} to print out out variable


			{% for course in courses %}
			# things in here will get done once for every course that is in our courses' list
			<h2>{{ course.title }}</h2>
			{{ course. description }}
			{% endfor %}
			
	since the fields belong to the model instance as attributes, we access them with the "."
	just like we would if we're looking at an object in like our shell

so let's make our view used our template ---- "courses/views.py"
we're gonna get most of ths work we did before, we don't need the "output" and "return"
we're gonna "return" the "render" function with 3 arguments
			def course_list(request):
    		courses = Course.objects.all()   # we select all the courses the exist
    		# output = ", ".join(courses)      # join them together with ","
    		# output = ", ".join([str(course) for course in courses])
    		# return HttpResponse(output)      # we return the HttpResponse that has all the names joining by commas
    		return render(request, 'courses/course_list.html', {"courses": courses})
    		
    		
   1st: the "request" come from the one above in "def course_list(request)" 
   2nd: take the template to render "'courses/course_list.html'"
   3rd: optional, takes a "context dictionary", because it is the context with which the template would be rendered
   			key name: 'courses', and it's going to be our ??? pick up early named 'courses'--(courses = Course.objects.all())
   	there are others arguments that "render" can take, but we're just handling this simple use
   
now run the server
====py manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:800, then go to the "http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/" page
it shows all the courses and theirs descriptions 

this is creating a template for an app, that's fairy straightforward, 
but what if we want to have a layout for the "Homepage",  the page--"http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
we made in "courses/learning_site/views.py", 
			from django.http import HttpResponse
			def hello_world(request):
    		return HttpResponse("Hello World")

it's view that doesn't live inside of an app
so we can't just add and "templates directory" to an app and be done with it
we get ??? template for it to our courses app but that doesn't make a lot of sense
because that page may not come with our courses' app, 
so we're gonna add a directory into our out of most "learning_site (最外面那个learning_site)
and we need to change our "learning_Site/learning_site/settings.py", 
find the "TEMPLATES = []" part, "'DIRS': [],"
		"TEMPLATE = []" is a list, each item of the list is a dict, each dict describes one way of rendering templates
		
		TEMPLATES = [
    	{
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',  
        'DIRS': [],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    	},
		]
		
		# BACKEND renders 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates'
			it uses the Django template renderer 
		#'APP_DIRS' directory is look for template directory inside of the apps
			let's say??? it does the templates courses things]
			
		what we care about is the " 'DIRS' = [] " list, it lets us specify other directories 
		that we want included for it to go to look for templates in???
		this actually works from the roots of the site---(第一个learning_site目录)
		how do we find in it teh directory? we name the directory "templates"
				'DIRS': ['templates', ],

now we need to create our template and change our view
create a "home.html" in "templates" directory
		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
then add our "views.py" in "learning_site/views.py"
	#from django.shortcuts import render
	#def hello_world(request):
  #  return HttpResponse("Hello World")
		
	from django.shortcuts import render
	def hello_world(request):
		return render(request, 'home.html')  # our template is "home.html"
		
	we don't have to give a directory on this one, because it doesn't live inside of another directory
	we don't have to include the "context" dictionary either, there is no context
	对比
	def course_list(request):
    courses = Course.objects.all()   # we select all the courses the exist
		return render(request, 'courses/course_list.html', {'courses': courses})
		
刷新页面,得到我们的"Welcome!"

you might want to change the view name from "Hello World" to something else, 
be sure you change the url (learning_site/urls.py) too, since it has the "view" name in it 

next part: template inheritance
