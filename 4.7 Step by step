we have courses, but each course should have steps to it, 
maybe it will be a video, maybe it will be text base steps or images, whatever method you want to teach with
we´re gonna call it "steps"

since "steps" are a logical part of our courses, we'll keep them in the same app
so inside "courses/models.py" we're gonna add a new model
		class Step(models.Model):
    	title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    	description = models.TextField()
    	order = models.IntegerField(default=0)  
    	course = models.ForeignKey(Course)
    	
    def __str__(self):
    	return self.title
    	
    	# so far the class "Course" and class "Step" are the same thing, just the created app
    	# but maybe we'll have an "order" field so we can specify what order, different fields??? come in
    	# then do a "course", will be a ForeignKey and link back to "Course"
    	# since we're (not???) gonna print these out eventually, we do return self.title
    	
    	# the 1st two items should be pretty familiar from the "Course" model, exactly the same
    	# the last two items are new
    	# "order" lets us control the order of the steps, a??? we forget to create a step and we have to create it later
    	# this way we can add a new one and then set??? where it should be in the order
    	# setting it to 0 so we can set other numbers to control the ordering of steps later
    	# 0 is a safe default that will order automatically by their id and then we'll handle their ordering later
    	# the "course" attribute is a ForeignKey, which is a record??? that points to, or a column that points to
    		a record in another table, can be in the same table but for now??? in some other table
    		so what we're doing is "Hey,here is this step and maybe it's a step id of 3 and then belongs to course with an
    		id of one,so it belongs to that course over there and points to that course", this way a single course can have 
    		multiple steps but each step only has ons course, it's known as the "one to many" relationship or real hanging???
    		from the step side and "many to one", many steps belong to one course
    # and the "__str__" method which will print out the tittle of the step
    # but I'll??? print out the order but I'll let you put that field if you want

now we've made our model, we of course have to create a new migration, you will do this a lot
you'll make a model then you'll make a migration, then you'll apply the migration
it might see monotonous(千篇一律的) and time-consuming, but it's good to know exactly what's going on behind the scenes
====py manage.py makemigrations courses
====py manage.py migrate courses
then done,so we've made a model, we can play with the shell if we want to, but it's easier to stick in the admin
and then go mess with the admin, so run the server again
====py manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000

then go to the "admin.py" and import "Step", just copy the first one and change "Course" to "Step"
		admin.site.register(Course)
		admin.site.register(Step)
		
so we've imported it and registered it, then go back to the "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/" and check it out
we can see in the "Courses" panel there are "Courses" and "Steps"
then let's add a step by clicking the "Add" button on the right
		Title: what's the deal with strings?
		Description: Strings are more than just a bunch of letters. Find out why.
		Order: 0
		Course: Python Basics (you can choose)
		
		# then let's "save" that, it shows up a flash 'the step "What's the deal with strings" was addded successful.'
		
add one course is ok, but if we have a lot of courses, this might get a little difficult, that drop down takes
it can take a while to read through, to find stuffs, probably better way and you know I wouldn't ask that unless it's true
Django lets us create smaller forms that represent another model inside the admin form for a model, 
so we can edit and create steps for courses while we're editing or creating a particular course
we need to create two new classes for this to work though, so let's hove back over to our "editor"
we have to??? do all of them right here inside the "admin.py",
so now first we need to make a class for our smaller form, that's known as an in-line
		class StepInline(admin.StackedInline):
			model = Step
		
		#there are two types of inline: StackedInline, and TabularInline
		#区别在于使用的模板, 一个横着，一个竖着，选项是一样的。
		
that's it, on its own, this doesn't do anything, but this creates the inline
now, we have to make our "Next thing"
		class CourseAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
			inlines = [StepInline,]
		
		admin.site.register(Course, CourseAdmin)
		admin.site.register(Step)
		
		# this is the admin for handling our courses, this supposed to specify custom special things
		# when we make the "StepInline" we set the "model = Step", we didn't set a model on "CourseAdmin"
		# we do that in the "admin.site.register(Course, CourseAdmin)"
		# we register "Course", and we register with "CourseAdmin"
		# if we want we can delete "admin.site.register(Step)" but we just leave it for right now
		
go back to page "Courses"-"Courses"-"Python Basics'
we can see  "Change course" section, "STEPS" section with "Step #2" / "Step #3" 
and if we want more we can just click "Add another Step"
we can edit and delete and add new steps right here in the admin

there's lot more we can do with inline,
