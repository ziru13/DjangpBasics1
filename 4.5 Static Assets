we're going to look anther template tag, one that lets us refer to the static media like 
CSS, Javascript or images in our templates
to get static assets we have to do a bit of work with our settings and our urls
so to start using our static assets and our "settings.py" we need to add at the bottom a new attribute/setting
add "STATICFILES_DIRS" which is a tuple(,) inside the tuple we need to add the path to locations for Django to find our "Static assets"
so these things are CSS files, images, javascript, whatever
os is already imported up at the top,  "base dir" which is our learning site

			STATICFILES_DIRS = (
				os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "assets"),
			)
			
			# BASE_DIR is our first "learning_site" "DIR" (directory)
			# join "BASE_DIR" with the word "assets", don't forget the "," at the end
			# so let's say "hey Django, if I ask you for static stuff, go look in this directory"
			
and let's create  the "assets" file and a "css" folder inside it, and a "layout.css" file (视频中已经帮你创建好)
before we can get to them though, we have to add a little bit more stuff,
if we were deploying this live, this is somewhere in the internet, we will be using a server like Apache/engine X
or in a window server and they would have a rule setup for how to find static stuff
如果你是把它放在网上你不要用django来显示你的static files,你会用另外一个工具
cuz we don't want to use Python to serve static stuff but now we're just in development,
we're just messing with this on our own machine, workspaces
it's cool if Python services are static files, so we have to tell Django how to do that

so let's go to "learning_site/urls.py", at the top we have those imports and add one more
		from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import staticfiles_urlpatterns
		
		# at the bottom, and "staticfiles_urlpatterns" is a function, we have to call it(with ())
		urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns()
		
		# what it does is it checks to see if we ran "Debug" mode which we are in the "settings.py"--DEBUG = True
		# and if we were in "Debug" mode, it adds a static path, "static/" 
		# that points to all of our files in our static folders, but now we need to use this

let's go to look at out "layout.html" template, in the <head> area and add a link
and add one more thing at the top, because "static" is not loaded by default, 
not every site is going to need static files, so Django doesn't load automatically
			{% load static from staticfiles %}
 			<head>
        <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/layout.css' %}">
    	</head>
    	
    	# href="{% static 'css/layout.css' %}"使用static标签, 
    	# 也会有人用href="{{ STATIC_URL}}{% static 'css/layout.css' %}"
    	# it's cool if your static url never changes, but if you´re gonna deploying your static assets on to sth like S3/cloudfront
    	# we might change, then you don't always want to have a url that never changes
    	# so we use the "static" tag, it can actually figure out what these urls are 
    	
***!!!! 注意在Django3.0中已经不用上面{% static 'css/layout.css' %}/{% load staticfiles %}/{% load admin_static %}
***!!!! 更改为{% load static %}

then go to the page to see if there is any CSS,此时页面没有发生改变,但是能看看到有CSS, 但是没有用
在添加一些内容到<body></body>之间
		<body>
        <div class="site-container">
            {% block content %}{% endblock %}
        </div>
    </body>
    
    # 再刷新网页,视频中"Welcome!"向右跑了一点,但是我的没有发生改变
