Model Administration---模型管理
前言:
		我们希望能将数据hold在我们的app里,因此我们需要创建至少一个模型(model)
		一旦我们有了一个模型,我们将会希望能够创建它的实例,
		Django的ORM(object relational mapper对象关系映射)和Admin(管理员) to the rescue
		
===========================3.1 What Are Models=========================================
In Django's ORM, or Object Relational Mapper, 在Django的对象关系映射中
Models are classes that represent database tables, 模型是代表数据库表单的类
each model is its own table, 每一个模型是它自己的表单
and each attribute on a class is a column in the table 在类中的每一个属性是表单中的一列
when we add new instances of a class in??? the database, 当我们在书库据添加一个类的实例时
the ORM creates a new row in the table, ORM在表单中创建一个新行/排
then we can select one or more rows in the table and update or delete them,然后我们可以选择表单中的一行或多行,更新/删除它们
			model:  	attribute  attribute  	attribute
									No.        name       phone
			instance		1					 Mixi				710
			instance		2				   Ziru				913
			instance		3					 Chicken    2021
			
Django's ORM offers us many more features than that, but we won't need all of them this course
let's just worry about creating a fairly simple model and getting it lie on our project
Models belong to an app, and live in the app's models.py, open the file, it's pretty empty to start with
but Django went ahead and imported the module that has all of the module functionality in it for us
Model name should be singular by convention, and quite often you are dealing with the single model instance
so it's weird to say I have this one apples???
=====models.py===========================
1. our model is going to be named "Courses" because it has been talking about courses, 
	 and as it is a class, it starts with the capital letter and inherit from "models.Model",命名我们的模型并宽展Model则个模型
	 which means that "models.Model" is the class that our models are going to extend
	 mostly your models you create the??? use Django gonna come from this base class
	 sometimes you have the customer??? base class, or you will be gonna taking advantage of things like multitable inheritance
	 we're gonna cover all that in a workshop course later on, 
2. now we need to add columns to our table, to do that, we add attributes to our class,给我们的表单添加列(属性)

	 we want to know when our class is first created, 
	 so we can see which instance is old and which one might need to be replaced, ect
	 also what is the newest one,
	 add a field called "created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)",  
	 what the attribute does is whenever the record is first added/created, it would automatically set "now"
	 "now" is decided by the timezone that we set in our "settings.py"--TIME_ZONE
	 	 		添加一个叫"created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)"的field
				添加/创建时间自动默认为你在"settings.py"文件中TIME_ZONE的'now'
	 
3. a course probably have a title, so let's create a title field with the argument "max_length"
	 how many characters can this possibly hold? like it could be upper most level, 
	 创建一个标题区域, 用CharField, 属性为最大长度为-----CharField(max_length)
	 
4. lastly, at least for this initial version our course probably needs a description
	 so people know what the course is about beyond of the title sets, so we'll use another field type here
	 "description = models.TextField()" ---创建一个文本区域
	 		TextField is a pretty free form, as far as the text contents go, it just holds text, whatever your text is
	 		it can be any amount of text, and most time you'll see this specify as being empty or lots of time you will,
	 		we're not gonna let this all??? be empty so they have to give us something, maybe some sort of text
 
			from django.db import models
		
			# Create your models here.
			class Course(models.Model):
				created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
				title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
				description = models.TextField()
		
5. so we have our model created, and we have our app, an??? installed apps
	it live in hte second "learning_site" directory, "settings.py"
	
		INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'courses',                    # 这个时你的app
    
6. so what we need to do now, if you remember when we talked about "Migrations" before, 
	 it's all about moving them from one design to another, 
	 or our design has changed if we added a new table, and our table has columns
	 so we need to "migrate" our database again, so we need to make migrations
	 we do that with the "manage.py" command, 我们通过manage.py命令来做migrations
	 
	 重新运行 cd learning_site/, 然后 py manage.py,然后会出现一大串commands信息,
	 so if you go look in the dos??? all link to it, there's a tons and tons of commands here available
	 the command we want though is  [django] "makemigrations", let's use that
	 we got output telling us that we've made the migrations, in the "migrations" file we got "0001_initial.py"
	 =================terminal: py manage.py makemigrations courses===========================
	 Migrations for 'courses':
  		courses\migrations\0001_initial.py
    		- Create model Course
    =================0001_initial.py===========================		
		in "0001_initial.py" is what our migration looks like, 
		it has a "operations" list, and "CreateModel" and object we've created 
		and the those settings we made before, an id automatically created by Django,不用我们自己指定
		
		# Generated by Django 3.1.6 on 2021-02-09 15:21
		
		from django.db import migrations, models
		
		
		class Migration(migrations.Migration):
		
				initial = True
		
				dependencies = [
				]
		
				operations = [
						migrations.CreateModel(
								name='Course',
								fields=[
										('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),
										('created_at', models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)),
										('title', models.CharField(max_length=255)),
										('description', models.TextField()),
								],
						),
				]
7. now we need to run the migration in the terminal specifying the name of the app "courses"运行migrations时要明确app的名字
	 if we don't specify the name Django just looks for anything inside ??? app that has unrun "migtations"
	 but we're gonna tell "hey just migrate this one app"
	===================py manage.py migrate courses==============================
		Operations to perform:
			Apply all migrations: courses
		Running migrations:
			Applying courses.0001_initial... OK

	 it applies all the migrations, our model states are rendered correctly and it applied courses 0001
	 that means our migrations ran everything is good to go

8. now that we have a model created and migrated, how do we use it?
	 in the next video we are going to talk about that
	 we will use Django super handy "shell command"
