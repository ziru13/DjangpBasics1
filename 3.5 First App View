let's make a view in our app that will list out all the available courses
we have to do a "query" to select all of the courses 
but I'm sure you remember how to do that in the last video

we're going to start in "courses/views.py"
Django provides us with an import at the top "from django.shortcuts import render"

a function name "render" that we haven't seen before, it's very handy for us when using templates
for this first view though, let's just return plain text like we did before, 
which means we need to import  " from django.http import HttpResponse" class again
and then we have to create a new view, a view to show a list of courses, 
so name "course_lists", and takes a "request" as an argument

since we want to use our "Course" model, we should import it "from .models import Course"
the "." means looks for the model's module in the current directory

now I can just use the model just like everything, and we're gonna use that
and merge it together into a string that joins all the titles and I will send that back
so we will have all the titles
		from django.http import HttpResponse
		from django.shortcuts import render

		from .models import Course
		# Create your views here.
		def course_list(request):
    		courses = Course.objects.all()   # we select all the courses the exist
    		output = ", ".join(courses)      # join them together with ","
    		return HttpResponse(output)      # we return the HttpResponse that has all the names joining by commas

of course to see this view, we have to create a URL for it, 
this is interesting when you want to do it for an application and you want to do it cleanly 
first thing, we don't have a "urls.py" in our app (courses目录), we should create one

===courses/urls.py====
we first thing need to import the url object from Django
and we all need to import our "views"
??? we have to create our url pattern's variable and fill it up with our url
it's weired that you have to name the variable exactly your url patterns
python doesn't usually do presciptive???, but it is Django, not just in python, 
Django can make whatever rules at once, let's make our variable


		from django.conf.urls import url

		from . import views
		# make our variable, a list, in the old Django, it didn't use to be a list, now it's just a list
		urlpatterns = [
    	url(r'^$', views.course_list), 
		]
		
		# I gave this the same url as our home page, is that going to matter?
===cd learning_site/
====py manage.py runserver 128.0.0.1:8000
		然后刷新网页,我们看到Hello World,所以没有关系,我们仍然得到home page
		那部分原因可能时我们的courses/urls.py这时候还没有被Django loaded
		Django doesn't automatically look for the urls.py inside the apps
		and we haven't told it to look there, so it hasn't, let's change that
		
go to the "learning_site/urls.py" from the project, and add a new line before the "admin" line
		from django.contrib import admin
		from django.urls import path, include

		from . import views

		urlpatterns = [
    		path('courses/', include('courses.urls')),  # 按照文件上面给出的指示写,一个include function
    		path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    		path('', views.hello_world),
		]
		
		# "include" function lets us include a set of url patterns from somewhere else
		   in this case we're including them from our "courses" app, but why in ''--include('courses.urls')
		   Django turns that string that we give it "courses.urls" this string, into an import path
		   which let us find the url patterns, 
		   this means we don't have to import the urls ourselves into every place we want to use them 
		   this really helps with "plugable" mess and ???lerety that we keep bringing up
		   
再次刷新网页,没有发生任何改变,如果去"http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/",会得到一个Error
since we include the 'courses.urls' at "/courses", ???the url we have there is an empty string
???as long as something comes after "courses", we got that course's view
but that view has a bug, let's see if we can fix that

		TypeError at /courses/
		sequence item 0: expected str instance, Course found
		
		we got the a Course at the beginning (Course found), and expected a "str instance"
		
回去"views.py", 
	we're using "join", it expects everything here to be strings, but those aren't strings, those are "courses"
	so we're gonna fix that with a quick little list ???, 
				output = ", ".join(courses)
	 改成:output = ", ".join([str(course) for course in courses])
basically what we have is a "for" loop inside of a list, so it creates a list over looking through the "for" loop

此时bug修好了,网页显示--http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/

but no one wants to have to go into the Django shell all the models instances, 
there has to be a better way
the "django-admin" is coming next!
